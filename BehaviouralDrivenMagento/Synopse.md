# Behavioral Driven Magento - Building the right software right.

Building software is hard, and building the right software is even harder. There are many different stake holders in software delivery and one of the problems I see is a lack of shared understanding. The inevitable outcome of this is teams developing software without knowing the full picture resulting in building the wrong software.


All is not lost, By adopting a combination of Agile and BDD we can work collaboratively on filling in the missing pieces to generate a complete "team based" shared understanding. Then by taking this conversation we can express the intent and purpose of the feature in code ensuring that the language we write code in matches the same business language we communicate to the entire team with.

This talk will present an overview of Behavior Driven Development combined with some key concepts from Agile to highlight how we gather and capture the conversation in user stories. We will then explore delivering code driven by conversation using Behat and PHPSpec as our driving design tools.
