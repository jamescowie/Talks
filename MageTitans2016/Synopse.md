# Object(ivly) thinking

## Introduction

Testing, Testing and more testing. We know we should be testing our code but what benefits does testing give us? Assurances that we can rapidly make changes
to code and ensure functionality is still kept intact. Well what if there was more than just code security that practicing testing could give us.

I believe that by thinking about Objects and going back to the fundamentals of OOP ( Object Orientated Programming ) and thinking about how objects
can communicate with each other we can design better applications adhering to SRP ( Single responsibility Principle ), SOLID and DRY and still retain
a well tested and more verbosely documented system. By exploring concepts from OOP, DDD, BDD and TDD I will show that we can extract business domain code and encapsulate
this into meaningful objects that are more testable, maintainable and showcase best OOP practices.
